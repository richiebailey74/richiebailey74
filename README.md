- 👋 Hi, I’m @richiebailey74 (Richard Bailey)
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and machine learning/AI. I also have high interests in applying neural networks to solving complicated problems in finance, genetics, energy, quantum mechanics, and politics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning time series machine learning and stochastic processes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and work for a preferably ML based internship.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email richiebailey74@gmail.com or my phone number 727-735-2881 (text or call me).


I am eagar to learn anything and everything. I am fully driven to push myself to my absolute limits to impact the world in the most impactful and positive manner.

Note: if this GitHub seems like it is lacking commits, it's because most of my commits are done under my work accounts (for internships) and under my school account (for classes), most content from which cannot be posted due to being proprietary software and course assignments/projects.
